About BetterThanCraigslist
The purpose of this project is so users are able to view,create/add, edit and delete items they are looking to buy using basic crud opperations, mongo db, express js routes, pug templates, and other various packages and functions used to create this website which will be displayed in the repository.
 
The index page is the main page of the website.It briefly outlines the purpose of the website along with some navagation links to direct users around the website.

Any user can view the items on the items page. However, if a user wants to create an add, edit the add and delete an item on the items page they need to register for an account or login if an accout has lready been created.

Users can register an account and use their login information to login to to the website.
Items added will be displayed on the items pages. One a user logs in they have the option to add an item, delete an item or edit information about the item.

When creating an item, a user will be brought to a form where they are able to upload an image,title, price and the city of the location of where the listed item is located.

For each pug page there will be a shared header and footer. Each pug page will extend or include the layout pug page for every page. Layout.pug will contain href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/4.5.0/cyborg/bootstrap.min.css which is the cyborg bootstrap theme obtained from bootswatch: https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/
